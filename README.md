# SA-MP-DOS-Exploit

Simple python script, exploiting vulnerabilities of version 0.3.7 of SA:MP servers,
the script consists of a flood of requests for cookies and connections, the server ends up crashing and crashing, will not look online to players.
This bug is still functional in version 0.3.7. This script was developed to test firewalls that aim to stop this exploit, I am not responsible for the misuse of this script!
Most of the servers are already protected against this type of attack so I didn't see a problem in making it available!
  Usage: python samp-exploit.py <IP> <PORT>

example usage: python samp-exploit.py 192.168.31.1 7777
